# cc_ts2_calc

 brief description of a calculator program in Python:

The program defines four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide, which perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.

The program prompts the user to select an operation from a menu of options: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exit.

If the user selects an operation, the program asks for two numbers as input.

Based on the selected operation, the program calls the corresponding function and computes the result.

The calculated result is displayed to the user.

The program continues to prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.

If the user selects the exit option, the program terminates.

This calculator program provides a basic interactive interface for performing arithmetic calculations using simple operations. You can modify or enhance it according to your requirements, such as adding more operations or incorporating additional features like handling errors or supporting advanced mathematical functions.
